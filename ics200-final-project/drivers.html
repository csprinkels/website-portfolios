            <h2>Takumi Fujiwara</h2>
            <p>He acts as the delivery boy for his father's tofu business, driving his father's Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX (AE86) up to the top of the mountain every morning to deliver tofu to the hotels for the day. After defeating Keisuke Takahashi in an impromptu battle he was nicknamed the "White Ghost of Akina" and began racing on his own, occasionally representing the Akina SpeedStars in battle. He was eventually invited to join Project D as their downhill ace.</p>

            <h2>Keisuke Takahashi</h2>
            <p>An ex-bosozoku gang member, he was introduced to street racing by his brother Ryosuke and joined his team, the Akagi RedSuns, and soon became their second best driver in his Mazda RX-7 Type R (FD3S). He and his brother are nicknamed "The Rotary Brothers", as they both drive cars with rotary engines. During the RedSuns expedition to Akina, he was defeated by Takumi Fujiwara in an impromptu battle, an event that helped kickstart Fujiwara's racing career and created a rivalry between the two. He was invited by his brother to join Project D as their uphill ace.</p>
